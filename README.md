# PolyEKF: Sparsity-Aware Extended Kalman Filter for Tracking Dynamic Graphs
*Lital Dabush, Nir Shlezinger, and Tirza Routtenberg*

This repository contains the official implementation of the Sparsity-Aware Extended Kalman Filter (GSP-EKF) for tracking dynamic graph topologies, as proposed in the paper:

üìÑ L.Dabush, N. Shlezinger, and T. Routtenberg, ``Sparsity-Aware Extended Kalman Filter for Tracking Dynamic Graphs".

## üß† Overview

The proposed method formulates the problem of topology tracking as a sparse nonlinear state-space model under the Graph Signal Processing (GSP) framework. The key contributions include:

- **GSP-EKF**: An EKF that incorporates ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-regularized updates to promote sparsity in dynamic graphs.
- **Efficient Jacobian Computation**: A dynamic programming-based scheme that enables tractable evaluation of the Jacobian for polynomial graph filters.
- **Observability Analysis**: Theoretical insights into the impact of sparsity and graph dynamics on system observability.
- **Extensive Experiments**: Validated on both linear and nonlinear graph filters across various noise levels and topological change rates.
